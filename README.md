# Hangman Game

This is a text-based Hangman game developed using Python as part of the CodeAlpha Python Programming Internship. The game selects a random word from a predefined list and allows the user to guess letters until the word is complete or the maximum number of incorrect attempts is reached.

## Objective

To create a simple and functional word-guessing game using basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and list manipulation.

## Features

- Predefined list of five words
- ASCII-based visual hangman structure
- Six allowed incorrect guesses
- Input validation for repeated and invalid inputs
- Replay option after the game ends

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Built-in modules: random, input, print

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed.
2. Run the script from a terminal or code editor:

```bash
python hangman.py
